/* Find the path with the maximum sum in a given binary tree. Write a function that returns the maximum sum.

A path can be defined as a sequence of nodes between any two nodes and doesnâ€™t necessarily pass through the root. The path must contain at least one node. */

const Tree = require('../../ds/BinaryTree');

// Note, this solution assumes all nodes will have positive values.
// T: O(n) --> we traverse each tree node once.
// S: O(n) --> n for the recursive stack.
// where n = # of nodes in the tree.

// This question is essentially same as tree-diameter, except that here, we keep track of the path sum instead of path length. The only other thing we need to keep in mind is any path that has a negative sum. In such case, adding this partial sum to the total path sum for a node will reduce the overall sum, so we should ignore any child path that has a negative sum - we will cut of any partial path that is overall negative.

const pathWithMaxSum = (root) => {
  const sum = { max: -Infinity };

  return sum.max;

  if (!current) return 0;

  let leftPathSum = pathWithMaxSumRecursive(current.left, sum);
  let rightPathSum = pathWithMaxSumRecursive(current.right, sum);

  // if any child path has a negative sum, we will ignore it, as adding it will reduce the total path sum.
